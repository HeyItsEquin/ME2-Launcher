# ME2-Launcher
A launcher for ModEngine2 instances (for Elden Ring modding)

### Heavily based on Metis Mod Launcher
Is this a reskin of Metis? Functionally, kinda. But it looks a little different and the underlying implementation is very different.
I am a beginner programmer and this is one of my first fully functional applications. As such, this is more of a learning opportunity for me than an app people are supposed to y'know... use.

### How does it work?
Idk
